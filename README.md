# sensor-fault-detection
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. This a binary classification Problem in which we try to find whether  the fault was due to certain component of APS or not.
